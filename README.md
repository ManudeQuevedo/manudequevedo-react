My new website is here! Feel free to take a look to the code and give me your honest opinion about it.

As a developer I'm constantly looking to improve and learn new things, if there's something you feel could be done better, please, let me know.

This repo is Open Source, so if you want to use it for your own personal usage, feel free to fork it and modify according to your own requirements.

## Hope you enjoy visiting my website.

### Important: I used Yarn for this project, do not use NPM or you'll start having Node Packages issues.
